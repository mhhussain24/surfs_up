# Overview of the Analysis
My client is looking to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. He has asked me to get information on temperature trends in the months of June and December in the area. This will allow my client to decide if the shop will be a success and if so, then to pitch his idea to potential investors and convince them that his shop will be a profitable business. 

# Results
The two summary statistics show my client and potential investors that in the month of June the infomation is as follows: 
- the average temperature is 75 degrees
- the minimum is 64 degrees
- the maximum is 85.

For the month of December the summary shows as follows:
- the average temperature is 71 degrees
- the minimum is 56 
- the maximum is 83

# Summary
Looking at the results of these queries it seems that the surf shop would be a success. Hotter months and colder months alike seem to bring in temperatures in the 70s. This could be great weather for ice cream and surfing year round. December is still reaching temperatures in the 80s which is a great sign, but business might be a little less busy than in June. 
I would also perform queries for the months of March and October to get a better idea of what year round weather would be like.
